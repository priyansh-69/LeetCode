Intuition:

The core idea behind checking for palindromes (numbers that read the same backward and forward) is to create a "reversed" version of the input number and compare it to the original. If they match, the number is a palindrome; otherwise, it's not.

Approach:

Handle Negative Numbers: Since palindromes are defined for positive numbers only, we immediately return false for negative inputs.

Extract Digits:

Initialize variables reversed to 0 and remainder to hold the extracted digits.
Use a while loop to iterate as long as the input x is greater than 0:
Extract the last digit using the modulo operator (x % 10).
Add this digit to reversed, multiplied by 10 to maintain digit order.
Remove the last digit from x by dividing by 10.

Compare Original and Reversed:

After the loop, check if reversed is equal to x. If they are, the number is a palindrome; otherwise, it's not.


Explanation:

The if statement handles negative numbers.
The while loop extracts digits and builds the reversed number.
The final return statement checks if the original and reversed numbers match.

Time and Space Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(log10(n)), where n is the input number. This is because the loop iterates up to the number of digits in the input, which is roughly proportional to the logarithm of n.
Space Complexity: O(1), as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

Key Points:

The solution avoids overflow issues by using a separate variable reversed to build the reversed number.
It handles negative numbers correctly by returning false.
It's relatively concise and efficient.
I believe this explanation incorporates the strengths of previous responses, addresses potential issues, and provides a clear and comprehensive understanding of the problem and its solution.
