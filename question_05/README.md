Let’s break down the intuition and approach of the given solution for finding the longest palindromic substring in a given string s.

A)INITIAL CHECKS:

1)The solution begins by checking if the length of the input string s is less than or equal to 1. If so, it directly returns s since any single character is a palindrome.
2)Otherwise, it initializes two variables: maxLen (to keep track of the maximum palindrome length found so far) and maxStr (to store the corresponding substring).

B)NESTED LOOPS:

1)The solution uses two nested loops to explore all possible substrings of s.
2)The outer loop iterates through each character in s.
3)The inner loop iterates from i + maxLen to the end of the string.
   The condition j - i > maxLen ensures that we only consider substrings longer than the current maximum length.
   Within this loop, it checks if the substring from index i to j is a palindrome using the isPalindrome helper function.
   
C)Palindrome Checking (Helper Function):

1)The isPalindrome function checks whether a given string is a palindrome.
2)It initializes two pointers: left at the beginning of the string and right at the end.
3)While left is less than right, it compares the characters at these positions.
4)If they are not equal, the function returns false, indicating that the substring is not a palindrome.
  Otherwise, it continues moving the pointers inward.

5)If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, the function returns true.
  Updating Maximum Length and Substring:
  If the current substring is a palindrome and longer than the previous maximum, it updates maxLen and maxStr.

D)Final Result:
After exploring all substrings, the solution returns the maxStr, which represents the longest palindromic substring found.

E) Complexity Analysis:
1)Time Complexity: The nested loops explore all possible substrings, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the length of the input string.
2)Space Complexity: The solution uses only a few variables, resulting in a space complexity of O(1) (constant space).

In summary, this solution exhaustively checks all substrings and identifies the longest palindromic substring. However, its cubic time complexity makes it inefficient for large inputs. More optimized algorithms exist for solving this problem, such as dynamic programming or Manacher’s algorithm.
