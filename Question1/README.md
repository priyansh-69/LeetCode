INTUTION:
The main goal of this code is to find a pair of indices in the given array (nums) such that the corresponding elements at those indices add up to the specified target value,
If such a pair is found, the function returns an array containing those indices; otherwise, it returns null.

APPROACH:-

NESTED LOOP ITERATION:

The code uses two nested for loops to iterate over pairs of elements in the array.

The outer loop (indexed by i) iterates over each element in the array.

The inner loop (indexed by j) iterates over elements to the right of the current element (i).

SUM CHECK:

Inside the inner loop, it checks if the sum of the current pair of elements (nums[i] + nums[j]) is equal to the target.

RETURN on Match:

If a pair is found where the sum equals the target, it creates an array (result) containing the indices of the two elements and immediately returns this array.
No Pair Found:

If no pair is found after checking all possible pairs, it returns null.
Example:
For instance, if nums = [2, 7, 11, 15] and target = 9, the function would return [0, 1] because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9.

In summary, the code iterates through all pairs of elements in the array, checking if their sum matches the target. If a matching pair is found, it returns the indices of that pair; 
otherwise, it returns null.
