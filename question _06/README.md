Approach and Intuition for Beginner-Friendly Coders:

Understanding the Problem:

The problem is to convert a given string s into a zigzag pattern with a specified number of rows (numRows).
The string should be read vertically, row by row, forming a zigzag pattern.
Data Structures:

The solution uses a StringBuffer array (array) to store characters for each row.
It utilizes a single StringBuffer (ans) to concatenate the characters from all rows.
Initializing the Data Structures:

array is initialized with numRows empty StringBuffers.
This array will be used to store characters in each row.
Traversing the Input String:

A loop iterates through the input string (s), distributing characters in a zigzag pattern.
Two inner loops handle the downward and upward movement, appending characters to the corresponding rows in array.
Vertical Downward Movement:

The first inner loop appends characters to each row, moving vertically downward.
Bent Upward Movement:

The second inner loop appends characters to rows in a bent, upward fashion.
Concatenating Rows:

After processing the entire input string, a final loop concatenates the characters from each row (StringBuffer) into the result ans.
Returning the Result:

The final result is obtained by converting the ans StringBuffer to a String and returning it.
Time Complexity:

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s. This is because each character is processed once.
Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(numRows) as it uses an array of StringBuffers to store characters row-wise.
Tips for Beginners:

Understand the problem thoroughly before diving into code.
Break down the problem into smaller steps or components.
Use clear and meaningful variable names to improve code readability.
Comment your code to explain complex logic or tricky parts.
Test your code with various inputs to ensure it works as expected.
Seek feedback from others to learn and improve.
